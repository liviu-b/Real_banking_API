# Banking API

A simple, scalable Banking API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API offers essential features for user authentication, account management, and transaction handling. This API can be expanded for larger financial systems, with core functionality such as deposits, withdrawals, and account balance tracking.

## Features

- User Registration and Login with JWT Authentication
- Create and Manage Bank Accounts
- Handle Transactions (Credit and Debit)
- Get Account and Transaction History
- Secure Access using JWT

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** and **Express**: Backend framework for building the API
- **MongoDB** (with **Mongoose**): Database to store users, accounts, and transactions
- **JWT**: For user authentication and secure API access
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing
